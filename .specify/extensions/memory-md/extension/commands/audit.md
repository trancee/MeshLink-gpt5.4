# Audit Memory

Review the memory files for quality.

Check for:

- stale entries
- duplicate entries
- trivial noise
- contradictions
- missing high-value lessons
- speculative entries
- overlong entries
- wrong-file placement
- feature-specific details leaking into durable memory
- missing synthesis or stale synthesis in active feature folders

Suggest:

- removals
- merges
- concise rewrites
- gaps worth documenting
- a follow-up question for each finding: do we need to address or clean up this finding?
- if a finding should be tracked externally, route it to `/speckit.memory-md.log-finding`

Use this scoring rubric for each kept or proposed entry:

- durable
- actionable
- non-obvious
- evidenced
- correctly scoped
- concise

Flag hard issues when an entry is contradictory, clearly stale, or stored in the wrong layer.
Flag soft issues when an entry is wordy, weakly evidenced, or duplicative but still salvageable.

Do not invent missing knowledge.
