# MeshLink Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Rigorous Code Quality

MeshLink is a cryptographic protocol library; code quality requirements
are mandatory because subtle defects create exploitable vulnerabilities.

- All production code MUST pass Detekt with zero suppressed issues.
  Suppressions in test code MUST include inline justification.
- All code MUST be formatted by ktfmt before commit. Manual style
  deviations are prohibited.
- The public API surface MUST remain tracked by Binary Compatibility
  Validator (BCV). Any `.api` diff MUST include a version-bump rationale
  in the PR description or linked planning artifact.
- Kotlin `explicitApi()` mode MUST remain enabled. All public
  declarations MUST declare explicit visibility modifiers and return
  types. Enforced in `meshlink/build.gradle.kts`.
- Merged code MUST NOT contain `TODO` comments. Unfinished work MUST be
  tracked as issues or spec items instead.
- Dependencies MUST use exact versions. Disclosed transitive dependency
  vulnerabilities MUST be overridden within the next scheduled sprint,
  or within 14 calendar days when no sprint cadence exists.

**Rationale**: Static guarantees and explicit contracts catch failure
modes that runtime testing alone cannot.

### II. Exhaustive Testing Standards

Every branch in MeshLink carries protocol meaning and MUST be testable.

- CI MUST enforce 100% line and branch coverage with zero
  `@CoverageIgnore` annotations. Enforced in `meshlink/build.gradle.kts`
  via Kover verification rules.
- Tests MUST use Power-assert for assertion diagnostics. Plain
  `assertEquals` is permitted only for structural comparisons where
  Power-assert cannot add diagnostic value.
- Protocol correctness MUST be validated against Wycheproof test vectors
  for ChaCha20-Poly1305, Ed25519, X25519, HKDF, and HMAC-SHA256.
- Multi-node integration tests MUST use the canonical virtual harness
  for the project, currently `MeshTestHarness` with
  `VirtualMeshTransport`, instead of real BLE hardware.
- Validation logic MUST NOT use `require()` with string interpolation;
  use explicit condition checks and throws instead.
- Long-running coroutine logic MUST NOT use `while(isActive)` loops;
  use structured coroutine patterns instead.
- Every `when` expression over a closed set MUST be exhaustive.
- Benchmarks MUST exist for benchmark-covered operations: AEAD
  encrypt/decrypt, routing table lookup, and wire codec encode/decode.
- Benchmark suites MUST run via kotlinx-benchmark on the JVM target.

**Rationale**: An uncovered branch in replay protection, key derivation,
or routing is a correctness and security risk.

### III. User Experience Consistency

MeshLink's public developer experience MUST behave the same across
Android and iOS.

- The primary public API surface, currently `MeshLinkApi`, MUST be
  identical in shape across all targets. Platform differences MUST stay
  behind consumer-invisible `expect/actual` implementations.
- Configuration MUST use one cross-platform DSL builder, currently
  `meshLinkConfig`. Platform-specific inputs MUST be injected through
  factory functions, not DSL branches.
- Diagnostic events MUST use one shared cross-platform catalog of 26
  codes with identical severity tiers and payload shapes on all
  platforms. Platform-only codes require constitutional amendment.
- Error reporting MUST use sealed exception hierarchies defined in
  `commonMain`. Platform exceptions MUST be wrapped and MUST NOT leak to
  consumers.
- State transitions (Uninitialized → Running → Paused/Stopped) MUST
  behave identically and MUST emit the same event sequence on every
  platform.
- Documentation parity is required: when Android documentation is added
  or changed for a public API or workflow, the corresponding iOS
  documentation for that same public API or workflow MUST be added or
  updated in the same change set.

**Rationale**: MeshLink's core promise is one consistent multiplatform
library, not two loosely aligned platform experiences.

### IV. Performance Requirements

MeshLink MUST meet quantified performance targets on resource-
constrained mobile devices.

- **Throughput**: Single-hop L2CAP transfer MUST sustain ≥80 KB/s on
  Android (Pixel 6+) and ≥60 KB/s on iOS (iPhone 12+).
- **Latency**: End-to-end delivery for a 1-hop, 256-byte message MUST
  complete within 50 ms at p95 after connection establishment.
- **Memory**: Steady-state heap allocation MUST NOT exceed 8 MB with up
  to 8 connected peers and an active routing table.
- **Battery**: In the LOW power tier, scan duty cycle MUST NOT exceed 5%
  and connection intervals MUST be ≥500 ms.
- **Cold start**: Time from `mesh.start()` to first advertisement MUST
  be <500 ms on both platforms.
- **Routing convergence**: Babel route tables MUST converge within 3
  seconds for a 10-node topology change measured through the canonical
  virtual transport.
- **Wire codec**: Encode and decode operations MUST complete in <1 μs
  per message on the JVM benchmark target.
- All performance targets MUST be validated by automated benchmarks.
  Regressions greater than 10% from the most recent benchmark result
  committed to the repository for that operation, or from the baseline
  explicitly linked in the planning artifact when no committed result
  exists, MUST block merge.

**Rationale**: BLE mesh networking operates under hard power, latency,
and memory limits that require explicit and enforceable budgets.

## Quality Gates

Every change MUST satisfy these release-blocking gates before merge.

- All work MUST occur on feature branches. Direct commits to `main` are
  prohibited.
- Every PR MUST pass the coverage gate required by Principle II.
- Every PR MUST pass the formatting and static-analysis gates required
  by Principle I.
- Every PR MUST pass the API compatibility and required platform test
  gates required by Principles I–III.
- Every PR MUST provide the benchmark evidence required by Principle IV.
- Every PR review MUST include the `plan-template.md` Constitution Check
  section, or a linked artifact containing the same
  principle-by-principle checklist.
- Any `.api` diff MUST include the version-bump rationale required by
  Principle I.
- Public API changes MUST satisfy the KDoc requirement of Principle III
  in the same change set.
- Documentation changes MUST satisfy the documentation-parity
  requirement of Principle III in the same change set.
- Dependency vulnerability fixes MUST merge within 5 business days of
  disclosure.
- Critical issues (CVSS ≥9.0) MUST merge within 48 hours.
- Commits MUST use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`,
  `docs:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `chore:`).

## Technical Constraints

All features and changes MUST respect these non-negotiable boundaries.

- All shared logic MUST reside in `commonMain`. Platform source sets
  (`androidMain`, `iosMain`) MUST contain only `actual`
  implementations and platform glue.
- The library MUST function with zero internet connectivity. No feature
  may introduce a server-side requirement.
- Minimum supported platform versions are Android API 29 and iOS 15.
  APIs exclusive to higher versions MUST use runtime guards.
- All shipped cryptographic operations MUST use the project's own
  provider abstraction, currently `CryptoProvider`, validated against
  Wycheproof vectors. No external crypto library may ship in the
  released artifact.
- Deployed FlatBuffers wire formats MUST remain backward compatible.
  Breaking wire changes require a major version bump and a migration
  period.
- The runtime dependency budget is exactly one runtime dependency,
  `kotlinx-coroutines-core`. Adding another runtime dependency requires
  constitutional amendment.

## Governance

This constitution is the supreme governing document for MeshLink
development.

- Any principle change MUST be proposed in writing before merge.
- Amendment proposals MUST include rationale, impact assessment,
  migration plan, and MUST record documented approval.
- Constitutional versioning MUST follow semantic versioning:
  - MAJOR: Principle removal or incompatible redefinition.
  - MINOR: New principle or materially expanded guidance.
  - PATCH: Clarification, typo fix, structural compression, or other
    non-semantic refinement.
- When guidance conflicts, this constitution MUST take precedence over
  READMEs, guides, and comments.
- Day-to-day conventions that do not rise to constitutional level MUST
  live in `docs/` or other project documentation.
