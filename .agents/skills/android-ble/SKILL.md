description: Android BLE development reference. Covers GATT/ATT concepts, central/peripheral roles, permissions (BLUETOOTH_SCAN/CONNECT/ADVERTISE on Android 12+, location for older), scanning (BluetoothLeScanner, ScanFilter, ScanSettings, PendingIntent for background), GATT connections (connectGatt, autoConnect, BluetoothGattCallback, service discovery, read/write characteristics, CCCD notifications), bound service pattern (BluetoothLeService lifecycle), background BLE (CompanionDeviceManager, WorkManager, foreground service), and app-layer security. Use when implementing BLE scanning, GATT connections, notifications, background BLE, or any Android BLE question.

**Android BLE** — built-in platform support for Bluetooth Low Energy in the central role. Scan for peripherals, connect to GATT servers, read/write characteristics, receive notifications.

### BLE Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **GATT** | Generic Attribute Profile — spec for sending/receiving "attributes" over BLE. All BLE app profiles are based on GATT. |
| **ATT** | Attribute Protocol — underlies GATT. Each attribute identified by 128-bit **UUID**. |
| **Service** | Collection of characteristics (e.g. "Heart Rate Monitor" service). |
| **Characteristic** | Single value + 0-n descriptors. The unit of data you read/write. |
| **Descriptor** | Metadata about a characteristic (human-readable description, acceptable range, CCCD for notifications). |
| **Central** | Device that scans and initiates connections (your Android phone). |
| **Peripheral** | Device that advertises and waits for connections (sensor, tracker). |
| **GATT Client** | Sends data requests (typically the phone app). |
| **GATT Server** | Fulfills data requests (typically the peripheral). |

### End-to-End Workflow

```
1. Declare permissions in manifest
2. Get BluetoothAdapter, check Bluetooth enabled
3. Scan for BLE devices (BluetoothLeScanner)
4. Connect to GATT server (device.connectGatt)
5. Discover services (gatt.discoverServices)
6. Read/write characteristics, enable notifications
7. Close connection when done (gatt.close)
```

### Scanning

```kotlin
val scanner = bluetoothAdapter.bluetoothLeScanner
val handler = Handler(Looper.getMainLooper())

// Always set a time limit!
handler.postDelayed({ scanner.stopScan(callback) }, 10_000)
scanner.startScan(callback)
```

Use `startScan(filters, settings, callback)` to filter by service UUID, device name, etc.

**Rules:** Stop scanning as soon as you find the target. Never scan in a loop. Can't scan BLE and Classic simultaneously.

### Connecting

```kotlin
// Direct connect (fail if device not available)
val gatt = device.connectGatt(context, false, gattCallback)

// Auto-connect (reconnect when peripheral comes in range)
val gatt = device.connectGatt(context, true, gattCallback)
```

### BluetoothGattCallback — The Core API Surface

```kotlin
object : BluetoothGattCallback() {
    override fun onConnectionStateChange(gatt: BluetoothGatt, status: Int, newState: Int) {
        if (newState == BluetoothProfile.STATE_CONNECTED) {
            gatt.discoverServices()  // always discover after connect
        }
    }
    override fun onServicesDiscovered(gatt: BluetoothGatt, status: Int) {
        // gatt.services now available
    }
    override fun onCharacteristicRead(gatt: BluetoothGatt, char: BluetoothGattCharacteristic, status: Int) {
        // async read result
    }
    override fun onCharacteristicChanged(gatt: BluetoothGatt, char: BluetoothGattCharacteristic) {
        // notification/indication received
    }
}
```

### Enable Notifications

```kotlin
gatt.setCharacteristicNotification(characteristic, true)
// Must also write to the CCCD descriptor:
val descriptor = characteristic.getDescriptor(UUID.fromString("00002902-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"))
descriptor.value = BluetoothGattDescriptor.ENABLE_NOTIFICATION_VALUE
gatt.writeDescriptor(descriptor)
```

### Always Close

```kotlin
override fun onUnbind(intent: Intent?): Boolean {
    bluetoothGatt?.close()
    bluetoothGatt = null
    return super.onUnbind(intent)
}
```

### Security Warning

BLE data is accessible to **ALL apps** on the user's device once paired. Implement app-layer encryption for sensitive data.

**service-pattern-and-background.md** — Full BluetoothLeService bound-service pattern (Service with LocalBinder, DeviceControlActivity with ServiceConnection, bindService/unbindService lifecycle, initialize() for BluetoothAdapter setup, connect(address) with getRemoteDevice, BluetoothGattCallback declared in service, broadcastUpdate via Intent for ACTION_GATT_CONNECTED/DISCONNECTED/SERVICES_DISCOVERED/DATA_AVAILABLE, BroadcastReceiver in activity registered in onResume/unregistered in onPause, IntentFilter construction). Scanning (BluetoothLeScanner from BluetoothAdapter.bluetoothLeScanner — null if Bluetooth disabled, startScan(ScanCallback) basic scan, startScan(List<ScanFilter>, ScanSettings, ScanCallback) filtered scan, startScan with PendingIntent for background process-dead scanning, ScanCallback.onScanResult delivers ScanResult with BluetoothDevice, always time-limit scans, stop when target found). GATT connection (connectGatt(context, autoConnect, callback) — autoConnect false = direct connect fails if unavailable, true = auto-reconnect when peripheral in range, Android <10 queues connection requests serially, ≥10 batches them, BluetoothProfile.STATE_CONNECTED/STATE_DISCONNECTED in onConnectionStateChange). Data transfer (discoverServices() immediately after STATE_CONNECTED, onServicesDiscovered with GATT_SUCCESS check, getServices() returns List<BluetoothGattService>, iterate services → characteristics by UUID, readCharacteristic async → onCharacteristicRead callback, writeCharacteristic, setCharacteristicNotification + write CCCD descriptor UUID 00002902-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb with ENABLE_NOTIFICATION_VALUE, onCharacteristicChanged for push data, broadcastUpdate with characteristic data parsing — heart rate measurement example with FORMAT_UINT8/UINT16, hex formatting for generic characteristics). Background BLE (PendingIntent scan wakes process when matching device found, CompanionDeviceManager for companion pairing with presence detection via startObservingDevicePresence, CompanionDeviceService with REQUEST_COMPANION_RUN_IN_BACKGROUND or REQUEST_COMPANION_START_FOREGROUND_SERVICES_FROM_BACKGROUND, WorkManager with PeriodicWorkRequest/OneTimeWorkRequest for connection tasks, foreground service with connectedDevice type for long-lived connections — launch restrictions apply Android 12+, stay connected while switching apps via foreground service or CompanionDeviceService, stay connected for peripheral notifications via setCharacteristicNotification + keep connection alive).
